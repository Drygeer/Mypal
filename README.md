### Things are changing.

I have been meanly removed from the mypal development.

No new versions of mypal will be from me. Someone else to take the relay race.
Also i may not provide the source code or else related to the palemoon, so this repository does not hold any source, it becomes shuch a checkpoint and reminder.
Everebody else  thouh may take the source from other places, and continue development, only be careful, examine the mozilla license, you will do things according the license then and no one can stop you.

For details read https://github.com/Feodor2/Mypal/issues/3

I am developing another mypal upon the firefox quantum 68-78, recently i have finished studying mozilla rust language and found that it is no problem to use rust to build for winxp.


Today 3.2.2022 i got the quantum running on winxp, great!
